# Trapeze

__Note: this project was formerly known as `capacitor-configure` but has now been expanded to support other mobile frameworks and renamed to Trapeze__

Trapeze makes it easy to automate the configuration of native mobile iOS and Android projects, and supports traditional native, Ionic/Capacitor, React Native, Flutter, and .NET MAUI.

See [Trapeze.dev](https://trapeze.dev) for full documentation.
