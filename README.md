# Trapeze

![Trapeze Logo](./logo.png)

Trapeze makes it easy to automate the configuration of native mobile iOS and Android projects, and supports traditional native, Ionic/Capacitor, React Native, Flutter, and .NET MAUI.

Trapeze features a configuration-driven tool that takes a YAML file with iOS and Android project modifications and performs those modifications from the command line interactively. Alternative, a Project API is available to write custom JavaScript/TypeScript project modification scripts for full control. The configuration tool uses this API under the hood.

See [Trapeze.dev](https://trapeze.dev) for full documentation.

__Note: this project was formerly known as `capacitor-configure` but has now been expanded to support other mobile frameworks and renamed to Trapeze as of June 2022__
