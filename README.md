Trapeze makes it easy to automate the configuration of native mobile iOS and Android projects, and supports traditional native, Ionic/Capacitor, React Native, Flutter, and .NET MAUI.

Trapeze works by automating the modification of pbxproj, plist, XML, Gradle, JSON, resource, properties, and other files in iOS and Android app projects. It features a configuration-driven tool that takes a YAML file with iOS and Android project modifications and performs those modifications from the command line interactively. A Project API is also available for writing custom JavaScript/TypeScript project modification scripts for full control. The configuration tool uses this API under the hood.

See [trapeze.dev](https://trapeze.dev) for full documentation and to get started using Trapeze.

__Note: this project was formerly known as `capacitor-configure` but has now been expanded to support other mobile frameworks and renamed to Trapeze as of June 2022__
